    - Dr. Murray is also the protagonist of the book *Epic Measures: One Doctor. Seven Billion Patients* by Jeremy N. Smith which tells an intriguing story that I enjoyed reading.
- Nate Silver tweeted on 2020-04-21 about [a way to summarize COVID-19 trajectories in different states](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1252774053796106240). The results are both weird and disheartening.
- My old friend Alan Salzberg weighs in on [How many people in the US have (or had) COVID-19?](https://salthillstatistics.com/posts/70) back on 2020-04-19.

- Chad Hazlett and David Wulf on [Learning the effects of COVID-19 treatments given outside of randomized trials](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340105786_Learning_the_effects_of_COVID-19_treatments_given_outside_of_randomized_trials)

- From FiveThirtyEight: [A Comic Strip Tour Of The Wild World Of Pandemic Modeling](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-comic-strip-tour-of-the-wild-world-of-pandemic-modeling/) by Zach Weinersmith, Maggie Koerth, Laura Bronner and Jasmine Mithani
- From The New York Times: [7 Ways to Explore the Math of the Coronavirus Using The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/learning/7-ways-to-explore-the-math-of-the-coronavirus-using-the-new-york-times.html) by Patrick Honner (2020-04-02).
- Maarten Lambrechts [tweeted out two versions of a plot](https://twitter.com/maartenzam/status/1250322010929946624) meant to look at how people who tested positive for COVID-19 reported their symptoms.
    - The tools used have R packages: including one that makes [Euler diagrams](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eulerr/vignettes/introduction.html) and one that makes [UpSet plots](https://gehlenborglab.shinyapps.io/upsetr).
    - The story and data under review here [are available at Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00154-w).
- Carl T. Bergstrom contributes [this discussion of whether we should divide by population size when plotting epidemic curves or death totals](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1249930293928030209). As he points out, the issue has become politicized in part because depending on what assumptions you make and how you visualize the data, the US can look like the worst in the world, or quite good. Bergstrom's "answer" is subtle, but worth thinking about.
- David Spiegelhalter has been busy.
    - from 2020-03-21: [How much "normal" risk does Covid represent?](https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196)
    - from 2020-04-11: [Does Covid raise everyone’s relative risk of dying by a similar amount? More evidence.](https://medium.com/wintoncentre/does-covid-raise-everyones-relative-risk-of-dying-by-a-similar-amount-more-evidence-e7d30abf6821)
- More recently, David drew [the graph below](https://twitter.com/d_spiegel/status/1249986522692096003?s=11) based on the latest data from [the UK's Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending3april2020). [David asks](https://twitter.com/d_spiegel/status/1249986522692096003): Why the massive rise in non-COVID deaths? How much is judgement of registering doctor? How much is collateral damage of lockdown?

![](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class20/figures/hyndman1.png)

- In that same post, Rob discusses why per capita numbers aren't shown instead, and describes the value of looking at log ratios.
- Rob also links to Kieran Healy's [Get Your Epidemiology from Epidemiologists](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/03/21/covid-19-tracking/) post, which shows R code to create this plot:

- Kieran Healy also has a very interesting post called [A COVID Small Multiple](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/03/27/a-covid-small-multiple/) which shows you how to build this...
