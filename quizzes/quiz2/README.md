## Deadline

Quiz 2 is due at 10 AM on 2020-04-20, as is specified on [the Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md).

## Instructions and Links to Resources

The quiz will cover materials associated with Classes 1-22 of 432, with the Course Notes and other materials we've provided by the end of Class 22, and with Chapters 1-13 of David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics*.

- The quiz will be taken using [the Google Form](http://bit.ly/432-2020-quiz2-answer-form) at http://bit.ly/432-2020-quiz2-answer-form.
    - **Note** In the Google Form, in item 9, choice d, `dad.ht` is shown with a hyperlink. I can't get Google Form not to create that link, but it doesn't go anywhere and you should ignore the hyperlink. `dad.ht` is just the name of a variable in the data set.
- In our **shared Google Drive**, you will find a folder called **Quiz 2**. There you will find 
    - a subfolder called data with four data sets that should help you complete the Quiz
        - The data files are called `quiz2_q09.Rds`, `quiz2_q18.csv`, `quiz2_q22.Rds` and `smart_oh14.Rds`.
    - a PDF copy of the Quiz, which is 37 pages long, and which contains all 24 items, and detailed instructions, including a list of R packages I used in developing the answers to the Quiz.
    - a 6-minute video recording of Dr. Love walking through the instructions for the Quiz
    - a Google Doc containing Key Links for Quiz 2 including to this page and to [the Google Form](http://bit.ly/432-2020-quiz2-answer-form).
- Look at the email stream with the subject heading "432 Quiz 2 is now available to you" which I sent on 2020-04-03, and be sure to read the second email I sent at 11 AM on 2020-04-03 to provide the Google Drive direct link, if you're not finding it on your own.

## Grading
