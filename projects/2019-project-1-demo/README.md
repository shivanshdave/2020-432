# Demonstration Project 1 from 2019

- Where can I see the HTML result?
    - on [Dr. Love's old RPubs site](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/project1_demo_2019-432).

- Where can I see the R Markdown file Dr. Love built the HTML with?
    - Here is [the complete R Markdown file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/2019-project-1-demo/432_2019_project1_demo_full_draft.Rmd).

- Are the "rules" in 2020 the same as in 2019?
    - Definitely not, but there is a good deal of overlap in terms of what we're looking for (in a proposal, especially.)
    - In terms of the presentation, building a document like this would be considerably more than is necessary to complete the poster requirement for 2020, but it would certainly be helpful to pull out relevant pieces from this work.
    
- Has Dr. Love made any attempt to "update" the code here since 2019?
    - No. I also make no guarantee that the methods in this demonstration will work perfectly for you, if you try to replicate my work.
    
- Where can I get the data?
    - The [cardiac.dat data are available here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/master/projects/2019-project-1-demo/cardiac.dat).

- Can I read the paper that describes this study?
    - Janine Krivokapich, John S. Child, Donald O. Walter and Alan Garfinkel (1999) "[Prognostic Value of Dobutamine
Stress Echocardiography in Predicting Cardiac Events in Patients With Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/references/pdf/Dobutamine_Stress_Echocardiography_1999_project1_demo.pdf)" *J Amer Coll Cardiology*, 33 (3: 1999 Mar 01): 708-716.
