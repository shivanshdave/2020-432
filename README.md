# 2020-432

This will be the public web site for my 432 course in Spring 2020 at Case Western Reserve University. 

## What Should I Do Prior to the First Class?

Our first class starts at 1 PM on Tuesday 2020-01-14 in E321-323 in the Robbins building at the School of Medicine. Prior to that time,

1. **Buy The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data** by David Spiegelhalter. 
    - We'll read the entire book this Spring, but I encourage you to read Chapters 1-5 soon.
    - The book is available online for less than $25 in hardcover, and less than $20 as an e-book. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541618513).
    - Here's [the book's website](https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics/) which contains code, corrections and other materials.

2. **Install the Software**: Install R (version 3.6.2 or later) and RStudio (version 1.2.5033 or later) and some necessary R packages. [Details here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md).

3. Reach me via via email at `thomas dot love at case dot edu` if you have questions about the course, especially after you review the materials linked on this page.

4. Be patient with me. Materials will appear on the web in fits and starts between now and the start of class.

## Staying Sharp over the Break

The best thing to do is analyze some data. I can think of no better place to keep sharp than working on some of the [Tidy Tuesday projects](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/) and I hope to spend some time on this myself over the break. There's a new data set every week!

- For instance, the [data for the week of 2019-12-03 involves parking violations in the city of Philadelphia](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-12-03).
- Here's the complete [list of 2019 data sets to date](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#2019).
- David Robinson's [video series continues on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/safe4democracy/videos).
