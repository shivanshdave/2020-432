# 2020-432

Welcome to Dr. Thomas E. Love's 432 course in Spring 2020 at Case Western Reserve University. 

## When and Where?

- Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1 PM to 2:15 PM in Room **E321-323** in the Robbins Building at the School of Medicine.
- Classes meet as listed on the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md). Our first session will be on Tuesday **2020-01-14**. 

## Key Links

- The [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md) serves as the final word for all deadlines and provides links for all classes and deliverables.
    - Each Class has an associated README page ([here's Class 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/classes/class01)) linked from the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md). 
    - The README is where we'll start each session, and where you'll find the slides Dr. Love presents.
- The [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-syllabus/) includes information on me, and on the teaching assistants.
- Dr. Love's [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/) will be edited and posted as the semester progresses. 
    - [The Spring 2019 version](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/) is still available, but I provide no guarantees.
- [Data and Code](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data) for the course.
- Instructions regarding [Software and R Packages](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md).
- The [R-Basics](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/r-basics) page contains several examples in Cleaning Data and Coding Analyses in R designed to help you with this course's assignments, particularly the first project. The main PDF here is about 60 pages long, so there's a lot of material to review.
- The [References page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/references) links to supplemental readings and related materials, including several online texts. 
- The website for my [Fall 2019 431 course](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431) will stay up through April.

## Stuff from before the class started

- After the first class, most questions and other feedback should be sent to Dr. Love and the Teaching Assistants via email: `431-help at case dot edu`. 
- Prior to the first class, or to contact Dr. Love individually, email `thomas dot love at case dot edu`.

## What Should I Do Prior to the First Class?

1. **Buy The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data** by David Spiegelhalter. 
    - We'll read the entire book this Spring, but I encourage you to read Chapters 1-5 soon.
    - The book is available online for less than $25 in hardcover, and less than $20 as an e-book. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541618513).
    - Here's [the book's website](https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics/) which contains code, corrections and other materials.

2. **Install the Software**: Install R (version 3.6.2 or later) and RStudio (version 1.2.5033 or later) and some necessary R packages. [Details here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md).

3. Materials will continue to appear on the web in fits and starts all semester. Take a look at what's already up.

## Staying Sharp over the Break

The best thing to do is analyze some data. I can think of no better place to keep sharp than working on some of the [Tidy Tuesday projects](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/) and I hope to spend some time on this myself over the break. There's a new data set every week!

- For instance, the [data for the week of 2019-12-03 involves parking violations in the city of Philadelphia](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-12-03).
- Here's the complete [list of 2019 data sets to date](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#2019).
