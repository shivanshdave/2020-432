# 432 Spring 2020 After the Class

Everything Dr. Love wants to tell you that is posted after the final class on 2020-04-23 is listed here.

## Please don't forget!

1. The University has asked you to evaluate the course at https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/. **Please do this** by their deadline, which is Thursday May 7. It really, really matters, especially this semester. 
    - If you've already done this, **please send me an email** to tell me that, and I'll stop pestering you about it.

## General Announcements

1. I've added more things to [the COVID-19 resources](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md).
2. The [Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 25 is available](https://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-25-feedback), and contains several pieces of information that you might want to look at before completing the course. Take a look if you can.
3. All Homework 1-4 Regrades are now complete, and I've let the relevant people know about my decisions.
4. The 431 and 432 web sites will disappear in June, so grab anything you need before June 1. If you need something after that, email me and I'll get back to you when I can, although you'll find my response time slows noticeably in the summer.
5. **If you'd like to be a TA** for 431 or 432 (or both) next year, we expect to have both paid and volunteer positions available. I'd be delighted to have you involved. Information about applying for positions will be emailed to you, likely between May 15 and June 15. If you have questions, let us know.

## End of Semester Materials

- [Visit this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/post-class/project2.md) to confirm what Dr. Love has received for you on Project 2, or the Project 2 alternate assignment.
    - As of 11:30 Monday night, Dr. Love has graded projects from 12 of the 45 students who completed the full Project 2.
    - He is hoping to complete grading so that you would have your grade by 5 PM Wednesday. No promises yet.
- People who did the alternate assignment for Project 2 or for Quiz 2 have an email from me indicating their grade on that work.
- People who did Homework 5 have an email from me indicating their grade.
- People who did Homework 6 have an email from me indicating their grade, and are in this set of [Links to the websites here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/homework/hw06/links.md).
    - If you build a website successfully any time after the deadline, **please** send it via email to Dr. Love with the subject line: **432 Homework 6: My Website** so he can see it and add it to the list.

## From May 4

Hi everyone.

Well, all of your projects are in (thank you for that) and I'm working on them. Wanted to pass along a couple of things tonight, as we conclude [Dave Brubeck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHdU5sHigYQ) night, [Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEcjgJSqSRU) day and [Cinco de Cuatro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3Y6sBl9JaA).

You might be interested in taking a look at [the 2.5 minute video I made tonight, linked here](https://cwru.zoom.us/rec/share/-MooM7Gt6nJJQqvA5lqPBI4IE5SiT6a8hykfqaYJxBsIX3jWimbNKahDK4qQkCWP?startTime=1588649877000). In the video, among other things, I show you some bookshelves I use to help build my courses. The pictures [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/post-class/IMG_6293.jpg), [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/post-class/IMG_6294.jpg), [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/post-class/IMG_6295.jpg) and [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/post-class/IMG_6296.jpg) show them in (perhaps) a less choppy form. I hope this is amusing/helpful/pleasant for you. 

And if you are one of the 9 (out of 49) in 432 or 6 (out of 11) in 500 that have yet to do the course evaluations, you'll find them at https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/

Make good choices, wash your hands, and let me know if you have any questions. In anticipation of one likely question, I am aiming to have grades for you sometime late Wednesday.
