# 432 Spring 2020 After the Class

Everything Dr. Love wants to tell you that is posted after the final class on 2020-04-23 is linked here.

1. The University has asked you to evaluate the course at https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/. **Please do this** by their deadline, which is Thursday May 7. It really, really matters, especially this semester.
2. I've added more things to [the COVID-19 resources](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md).
3. The [Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 25 is available](https://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-25-feedback), and contains several pieces of information that you might want to look at before completing the course. Take a look if you can.
4. All Homework 1-4 Regrades are now complete, and I've let the relevant people know about my decisions.
5. The 431 and 432 web sites will disappear in June, so grab anything you need before June 1. If you need something after that, email me and I'll get back to you when I can, although you'll find my response time slows noticeably in the summer.
6. **If you'd like to be a TA** for 431 or 432 (or both) next year, we expect to have both paid and volunteer positions available. I'd be delighted to have you involved. Information about applying for positions will be emailed to you, likely between May 15 and June 15. If you have questions, let us know.

## Alternative Project 2

It is my impression at the moment that everyone is doing a full Project 2, and no one is doing the one-hour alternative.
