## Announcements

1. A student asked "What's the difference between a count outcome and a quantitative outcome?" 
    - The possible values. A quantitative outcome is any quantity - it includes ratios, percentages, fractions, decimal places, negative numbers, anything that can be expressed on a continuous scale in addition to counts. Counts are a subset of quantities - they start at 0 and increase by integers, so those are the only possible values. A Poisson distribution, for instance, would be an option to use in modeling a count. A Normal distribution is what we typically use for other types of quantitative outcomes.
2. If you haven't already done so, please verify that you can access the Google Form for [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/quizzes/quiz2) and the shared drive containing my video recording, the four data sets, and the PDF file containing the instructions and items.
