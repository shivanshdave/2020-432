## Presenting Research

- Usually, this is highly abridged
  - Slide shows
  - Abstracts
  - Journal articles
  - Books
  - Websites

Your job is usually to announce the findings and try to convince us that the results are correct.

## You Have Ten Minutes?

- No time for subtlety.
- Round, a lot.
- Edit, ruthlessly.
  - One pass through software ("default options") is never enough.
  - Better for people to leave the table hungry than stuffed.
- Have something to say, and say it clearly.
- Some possibilities are never a good choice.

## Clearly Communicating Quantitative Information

- Are the most important elements or relationships visually most prominent?
- Are the elements, symbol shapes and colors consistent with their use in previous graphs?
- Are all of the graphical elements necessary to convey the relationships?
- Are the graphical elements accurately positioned and scaled?

## What are you trying to do?

- Is this **information visualization** (grabby, visually striking - dramatize the problem to draw the casual viewer in deeper) 
- Or **statistical graphics** (reveal patterns and discrepancies for viewers who are already interested in the problem)

Make tradeoffs carefully - meaningful choices.

# Data Visualization: Napoleon's Russian Campaign

## Wainer: Chapter 4 of *Visual Revelations*

![](figures/wainer-visual-revelations-chapter4-1.png)

## The History

It's 1812.

- Napoleon has most of Europe (outside of the United Kingdom) under his control.
- But he cannot break through the defenses of the U.K., so he decides to place an embargo on them.
- The Russian Czar, Alexander, refuses to participate in the embargo.

So Napoleon gathers a massive army of over 400,000 to attack Russia in June 1812.

- Meanwhile, Russia has a plan. As Napoleon's troops advance, the Russian troops burn everything they pass.

## What are we looking at?

- The numbers of Napoleon's troops by location (longitude)
    + Organized by group (at one point they divided into three groups) and direction (advance, then retreat)
- The path that his troops took to Moscow and back again
- The temperature experienced by his troops when winter settled in on the return trip
- Historical context, as shown in the passage of time
- Geography (for example, river crossings)
