## Today's Announcements

1. Thanks for completing the Roster Check, and thanks especially to those who completed the Minute Paper after Class 1 in a timely way. I really appreciate it.
    - [Minute Paper after Class 1 Feedback is here](http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-01-feedback).
2. I updated Chapter 2 of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/) and an update to Chapter 3 is coming soon. This also affected the [Data and Code](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data) page. Considerable additional material is coming soon.
3. I'll open Canvas up for this course before our next class, but I haven't done that yet, if you're wondering.

## Podcast Recommendations

- Roger Peng and Hilary Parker's [Not So Standard Deviations](http://nssdeviations.com/) is also about statistical issues, and is relevant to both academics and people working (or looking to work) in industry.
- Roger Peng and Elizabeth Matsui produce [The Effort Report](http://effortreport.libsyn.com/) which is about academic life in medicine, as much as anything else, framed through the lenses of a statistician and a clinician who do research together.
- The [Casual Inference](https://casualinfer.libsyn.com/) podcast, with Lucy D'Agostino McGowan (Wake Forest) and Ellie Murray (Boston U) has been recommended to me by several people and they have some great guests to talk about core concepts in epidemiology and biostatistics. I've only listened to one episode, but it was great.
- David Spiegelhalter appeared on a [recent episode of *The Guardian's* Science Weekly podcast](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2019/apr/05/cross-section-david-spiegelhalter-science-weekly-podcast) to discuss statistics and its importance to medical scientist.
- [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/fivethirtyeight-podcasts/) runs both a sports and a political podcast. The "Model Talk" episodes are particularly great for me.

## Visualization of the Day

Today, we'll spend some time reviewing the latest forecast of the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary from Nate Silver and the folks at [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), at [Who Will Win The 2020 Democratic Nomination?](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/)

- You may be interested in [How Our Primary Model Works](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeight-2020-primary-model-works/) by Nate Silver, posted 2020-01-09.
- The Ohio primary isn't until 2020-03-17 (which is two weeks after "Super Tuesday" so we'll happens before then. I expect that not all of the current candidates will still be candidates.

## What's Coming Up?

1. Read *The Art of Statistics* through Chapter 3. (I'd read through Chapter 5 were I you.)
2. Get started on [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/homework/hw01) which is due 2020-01-28. 
    - There are three questions.
    - Question 1 is about building a Table 1. You can do that now.
    - Question 2 is mostly about building some graphs to think about an ANOVA model. You can certainly do that part, even if you're not totally comfortable thinking yet about the interaction term when you actually build the model.
    - Question 3 is an essay reacting to Spiegelhalter, especially his Chapter 5, so reading that Chapter is necessary.
3. Anticipate that there will be a lot of new information appearing between now and Tuesday's class on the site, including project details.
4. Remember to **ASK US FOR HELP** at `431-help at case dot edu` or stop by [TA office hours](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md#tas-and-office-hours), which start tomorrow and then resume Tuesday.
