2. The Strength of Evidence vs. Quality of Question plot comes from this [2019 blog post from Roger Peng](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/04/17/tukey-design-thinking-and-better-questions/). 
    - Thanks to Abby Roche for reminding me of the power of this message.

I wrote this up last year, made some tiny changes to reflect the differences in your project so perhaps you'll find it helpful.

7. You may be interested in [this webinar series](https://statds.org/events/webinar_dsa2020/index.html) which "aims to promptly
disseminate the newest data science methods, tools, and findings in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, facilitate the exchange of
research ideas, and engage collaborations between data scientists and field experts worldwide to solve the COVID-19 crisis."

8. Remember, most of us are not working from home, **we are at our home during a crisis trying to work**. The TAs and I would like to help you. If you have questions or need some help, please let us know.

## One Last Thing

If we have time, we'll discuss the [IHME (University of Washington) COVID-19 Projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections) a bit, and in particular [some of these tweets from Carl T. Bergstrom](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1244815009303023616?s=20) are motivating my thoughts. I want to try to help you spread the word to people who haven't caught on to the distinction between the UW model and other models (like the initial Imperial College projections - see [Report 9 here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/).)

The 538 article I mentioned is [Why It’s So Freaking Hard To Make A Good COVID-19 Model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/).
