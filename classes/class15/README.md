# 432 Spring 2020 Class 15: 2020-03-19

## Connecting to Today's Class via Zoom

- The Zoom meetings for our 432 classes will be open from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, beginning 2020-03-19.
    - The classes themselves will start at 1:00 and end by 2:15, but we want to provide some flexibility before and after class for students to chat amongst themselves or with Dr. Love.
- **You will need to register in advance for the meeting using the link sent to your email on 2020-03-17 with the subject line "Invitation to Register for Zoom CLASS MEETINGS for 432 with Professor Love (IMPORTANT)".** After you register, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting. 
    - As I understand it, once you've done this registration the first time, you should then be able to join the subsequent class meetings without re-registering, and the meetings should appear on your Zoom calendar and can be added to your Google Calendar or other time management tools.
- Before class, be sure you've logged into [Zoom via CWRU](https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/zoom/zoom-information) and obtained the application for your computer or tablet.

## Plans for the Rest of the Semester

Here is a [Google Doc](http://bit.ly/432-next-steps) containing (and amplifying on) the emails I've sent this week. I won't update it again after noon today.

## Virtual TA Office Hours via Zoom

Teaching Assistant Office Hours will be held virtually starting 2020-03-18 and running through 2020-05-01 via [Zoom](https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/zoom/zoom-information).

- Details on how to access the Zoom office hours were sent to your email on 2020-03-17, under the subject line: "**Office Hours for 432: Connecting to Zoom TA Office Hours in Spring 2020 (IMPORTANT)**"
- You can, of course, also submit questions via `431-help` at any time.

The schedule for TA office hours is provided [in this section of the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours).

## How Has the Course Changed, besides Remote Delivery?

1. I've updated the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md).
    - The next two items are the [Minute Paper after Class 15](http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-15) (by tomorrow at noon) and [Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/homework/hw04) for 2020-03-25.
    - Submission of Minute Papers is now optional. It can only help you, and us, to do them. Dr. Love will craft a response at some point after the "deadline."
2. I've added detailed [Hints for Homework 4, revised 2020-03-21](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/homework/hw04/homework4_hints_2020-03-21.pdf) and relaxed the deadline for [Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/homework/hw04) to 2020-03-25.
    - If you want to request a regrade on Homeworks 1-4, [the form is now available](http://bit.ly/432-2020-homework-regrade-requests) through 2020-04-24.
3. Complete [Project 2 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project2) are now available, as is the [Proposal Google Form](http://bit.ly/432-2020-project2-proposal-form) that's due April 1. 
    - The [other three deliverables](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project2) for Project 2 are now due on 2020-05-04. 
    - The document is long, so this may not be obvious, but in fact I've scaled back the requirements quite a bit, and provided more guidance than I'd originally planned. I've also changed the grading structure for this project.
4. [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/quizzes/quiz2) has been pushed back so that you'll receive it 2020-04-03 and it's due on 2020-04-20. 
    - I've [provided some information](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/quizzes/quiz2) about what will be involved in Quiz 2.
    - There will not be a Quiz 3.
5. [Homework 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/homework/hw05) is now optional, and due 2020-05-04 if you want to do it. I hope you will enjoy it.
6. [Homework 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/homework/hw06) is also optional, and also due 2020-05-04 if you want to do it. I hope you will enjoy it.
7. I have also revised the plan for determining course grades, and [discuss the new approach here](http://bit.ly/432-2020-grading-plan).

## Announcements

1. **COVID-19** I am compiling some [Data and Resources related to COVID-19](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md) to help you with Homework 5, and to point you to some potentially useful materials.
2. **Updating R seems like a good idea now.** Version 3.6.3 of R is now available. [I encourage you to upgrade](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md). At the least, you should [update your R packages](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md).
    - The `countreg` package: To build rootograms to visualize the results of regression models on count outcomes, I have decided to use the `countreg` package, which is available **on R-Forge only**. To install `countreg`, type `install.packages("countreg", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")` into the R Console within R Studio.
3. **Updating R Studio isn't important now.** The new version of R Studio (version 1.3.919-2) is [available for preview](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). It has [many nice new features](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview-release-notes/), but like all preview versions, installing it may require subsequent re-installs later to fix issues. If you're someone who's comfortable dealing with those sorts of issues, feel free to upgrade, but continuing with version 1.2.5033 for the rest of the semester is an equally fine choice.
4. **There is a Minute Paper after Today's Class** We'd appreciate it you completed the form at http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-15 before noon on Friday 2020-03-20.
    
## What Hasn't Happened Yet?

Grading on Project 1 has taken a back seat. 

- I completed initial portfolio review for every project, and final portfolio review for a few before things got a bit out of control. I have also reviewed a couple of the project posters. 
- I will complete all of the remaining portfolio reviews first, then move to the posters. 
- It's going to take quite a while (at least a week) to get all of that done, and I'll have to update you further at our next class.

I also haven't gotten around to [updating the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/), but I will, soon.

## One Last Thing

Good luck to you all in these new circumstances, and as we say a lot around my house these days:

> Now would be a good time to wash your hands.
