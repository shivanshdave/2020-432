- The [COVID-19 Resources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md) will remain available through May, although I don't expect to keep updating it past this week.

## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 23 is available at https://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-23-feedback.
2. The Quiz 2 answer sketch is now available on our shared Google Drive in the same place where you found the materials for Quiz 2.
    - Quiz 2 grades will be available to you by class time on Thursday, although you should be able to figure them out from the sketch.
4. R 4.0.0 is scheduled for release this Friday 2020-04-24. I will happily accept projects that use version 3.6.2, 3.6.3 or 4.0.0 of R. I don't know how much trouble this will cause you - I hope it won't break anything important, but it's a major release - you may want to finish your project first and then upgrade.

## One More Thing

Dotplots are really underused. This is an example from a 2017 story on [The Identity Politics Of The Trump Administration at FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-identity-politics-of-the-trump-administration) by Perry Bacon, Jr.

Of course, [the Love plot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cobalt/vignettes/cobalt_A0_basic_use.html#love.plot) is a prime example of a dot plot, so it's perhaps not a surprise that I like them.
