## Today's Announcements

1. In [Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/homework/hw03) Question 5, I changed the question this morning. It now reads: 

> For the model you selected in Question 4, interpret the odds ratio associated with the ldl main effect carefully, specifying a 90% uncertainty interval and what we can conclude from the results. 

This should shorten the needed response considerably. If you've already turned in the homework with a more complete assessment, OK, but in reviewing the answer sketch, I feel the need to shorten the interpretation requirement.

2. The TAs have completed an initial review of your Project Proposals. Now, it's up to me to look them over and release next steps. That should happen before class on Thursday.

- The students listed below submitted proposals that were initially graded as 8, 9 or 10 by the TAs, so they might be pretty close after Dr. Love's review...
    - Hussam Alqahtani & Kimberly Noriega
    - Ebtesam Alshehri & Carolyn Goldschmidt
    - Rebeka Bordi & Sangeetha Raghupathy
    - Sofija Conic
    - Lauren Cruz & Kara Hageman
    - Farrah Gao
    - Logan Harper
    - Vanessa Ho
    - Jason Huang & Yufei Li
    - Shiying Liu & Yiheng Pan
    - Noah Lorincz-Comi
    - Yuxuan Luo
    - Stephanie Merlino Barr
    - Ryan Moore & Khaled Shorbaji
    - Troy Neptune
    - Vineet Punia
    - Abby Roche
    - Abigail Rippin
    - Alena Sorensen
    - Matt Siuba
    - Emily Tyszka
    - Anastasia Vassiliou
    - Gi-Ming Wang
    - Siyu Wang
- The remaining project proposals had larger problems identified by the TAs and should anticipate the need for a more complete revision. Dr. Love will tackle those proposals first in building up final responses.
